# Blinkit-Sales-Data-Analysis
Sales performance analysis on the Blinkit dataset to evaluate performance across product categories, outlet sizes, and establishment years. Identifies top revenue drivers and key historical trends.
This project features a comprehensive Sales Performance Analysis conducted on a retail dataset (Blinket). The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence using Python, focusing on three core areas:

Product Performance: Analyzing sales by item type and fat content.

Outlet Demographics: Evaluating sales based on location tier and outlet size.

Historical Trends: Identifying performance patterns based on outlet establishment year.

The entire analysis culminates in a six-panel data visualization dashboard and a business-ready PowerPoint presentation summarizing the key findings.



**Technologies & Libraries Used**
